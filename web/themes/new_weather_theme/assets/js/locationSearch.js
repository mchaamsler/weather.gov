        // the button and then popup a message when they click it letting them
        // know they need to change their browser settings, maybe that's useful.

        // whether it's a browser setting or an operating system setting, so we
        // can't give them any more helpful advice than "check your settings."
        //
        // In case 3, however, we should just leave the user alone. They have
        // already said no, and that should be the end of it.
