      <h2>Leaflet with custom hazards</h2>

      <p>
        This map uses Leaflet as the mapping library, OpenStreetMap as the base
        map, and NCEP's geospatial WMS services for radar. It only displays
        hazards relevant to the current location, and for the purpose of this
        test case, the alerts are faked.
      </p>

      <div class="usa-alert usa-alert--warning margin-y-4">
        <div class="usa-alert__body">
          <h4 class="usa-alert__heading">Risks</h4>
          <div class="usa-alert__text">
            <p>
              With this approach, we continue to assume the risk of correctly
              displaying relevant alerts for users. NCEP's services show all
              alerts, so any relevant alerts will be displayed by virtue of
              existing. We lose that "free" correctness by managing alert
              polygons ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also limit what alerts are shown on the map to just those that
              are relevant for the loaded page. If users navigate around, they
              wont see other, nearby alerts. We could conceivably create an API
              of our own to return alert polygons for any arbitrary map area,
              but that's new work and introduces issues of uncacheable
              duplication.

      <h3>Use cases for MVP</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I want to view radar reflectivity over time to see how precipitation
          is forming around me
        </li>
        <li>I want to view an active hazard on a map to see if I'm impacted</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Musts for MVP include:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Can support radar reflectivity and hazard area</li>
        Yes. Radar is coming from
        <a href="https://opengeo.ncep.noaa.gov/geoserver/www/index.html"
          >NCEP's geospatial services</a
        >. Alert polygons would be drawn by our code a single time and would not
        require any additional network traffic. However, there could be
        substantial traffic in sending the polygons from our server to the
        browser, especially for county-based alerts because county boundaries
        are defined by a
        <strong><em>LOT</em></strong>
        of points.
        <li>
          Work on desktop and mobile (is there a bandwidth minimum required)
        </li>
        Works fine. Bandwidth requirements will be about the same either way.
        Mobile users may have slightly reduced bandwidth requirements because
        their viewport is narrower and, as a result, they load fewer image
        tiles, but it would be negligible.
        <li>Load quickly (determine time threshold)</li>
        The primary source of initial load time will be fetching the Javascript
        and image tiles. The Javascript can be cached in the browser for long
        periods of time, so this should be a one-time cost. The cost of loading
        image tiles is independent of what map library we use.
        <li>Display a marker for my location</li>
        Yes. We can put all kinds of things on the map ourselves. Because it's
        under our control, we also have control over styling it, including
        making the point "ping" in an animated way to help draw the user's
        attention.
        <li>
          Automatically zooms and aligns location pin in the center of map (need
          to determine zoom level)
        </li>
        Setting the initial location and zoom will require custom code in every
        case, but it should be pretty minimal. For Leaflet, it's very
        straightforward. The "hard" part will be getting the location
        information embedded into the page so the map code can access it, but
        we're already addressing that elsewhere so it shouldn't be a problem.
        <li>Zoom</li>
        Yes. Leaflet provides buttons and responds in expected ways to trackpad
        and touchscreens (pinch to zoom, etc.).
        <li>
          Base Map must include
          <ul>
            <li>State borders</li>
            OpenStreetMap has state borders.
            <li>Names of cities and towns</li>
            OpenStreetMap has cities and towns.
            <li>Major roads</li>
            OpenStreetMap has roads. At more zoomed out, this is only major
            roads, but as you zoom in, more and more arterial and surface roads
            come into view. It's possible that this is actually too cluttered
            and makes it harder to understand.
            <li>County borders (will this impact load)</li>
            OpenStreetMap has county borders if you zoom in far enough. They're
            faint and not labeled, so they're hard to make out. If we wanted
            more distinct county boundaries, we'd need to use either a different
            base map or add a county border layer on top of this map. Adding
            layers increases the time for the map to fully load.
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Supports animation</li>
        Not directly. We have to handle animation in custom code by stepping
        through timestamps in the WMS layer.
        <li>Supports timestamp</li>
        Not directly. We have to create, place, and manage the timestamp label.
        <li>Supports a legend for defitions</li>
        Not directly. We would have to create this.
